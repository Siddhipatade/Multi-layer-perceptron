# Multi-layer perceptron

- A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a fully connected class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). 

- MLPs are neural networks with at least three layers while DNNs are neural networks with additional or deeper layers.

- A Multilayer Perceptron has input and output layers, and one or more hidden layers with many neurons stacked together. 

- Also the neuron must have an activation function that imposes a threshold, like ReLU or sigmoid, neurons in a Multilayer Perceptron can use any arbitrary activation function.
